<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-phthalate Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported Catalyst</li><li>Unsupported Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Supported catalysts are those where the active metals or compounds are supported on a solid support material, providing higher surface area and improved catalytic efficiency. Unsupported catalysts are those where the active materials are not supported by a solid material, exposing the active sites directly to the reactants. Supported catalysts offer better stability and reusability, while unsupported catalysts typically have higher catalytic activity. Both types play a crucial role in the non-phthalate catalysts market, offering different advantages based on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
