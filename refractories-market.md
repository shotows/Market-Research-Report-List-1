<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractories Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaped Refractories</li><li>Unshaped Refractories</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refractories market includes two main types - Shaped Refractories and Unshaped Refractories. Shaped Refractories are precast and molded into specific shapes and sizes before being heat treated, making them ideal for lining furnaces and kilns. On the other hand, Unshaped Refractories are monolithic materials that are applied in a wet state and then dried or heat treated in place. They are commonly used for patching or repairing existing refractory linings. Both types play a crucial role in the high-temperature industries like steel, cement, and glass manufacturing.</p></p>
