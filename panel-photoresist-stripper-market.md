<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Panel Photoresist Stripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent</li><li>Semi-aqueous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Panel photoresist stripper is used in the semiconductor industry to remove photoresist residues from panels after the patterning process. There are two main types of panel photoresist strippers: solvent-based and semi-aqueous. Solvent-based strippers use organic solvents to dissolve and remove the photoresist, while semi-aqueous strippers use a combination of water and organic solvents. Solvent-based strippers are generally more effective at removing tough residues, while semi-aqueous strippers are preferred for their lower environmental impact and reduced toxicity. Both types of strippers play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p></p>
