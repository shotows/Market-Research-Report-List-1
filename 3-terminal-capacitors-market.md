<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3-Terminal Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>SMD or SMT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3-Terminal capacitors are commonly found in three types of markets: radial, SMD (Surface Mounted Device), and SMT (Surface Mount Technology). Radial capacitors have two leads that come out from the same side of the component, making them easy to install on circuit boards. SMD capacitors are smaller in size and are directly soldered onto the surface of the PCB. SMT capacitors are similar to SMD capacitors but are designed for automated assembly processes, making them suitable for high-volume production.</p></p>
