<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Test and Analysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Assays and Test</li><li>Competitive Assays and Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lateral Flow Test and Analysis Market consists of two types: Sandwich Assays and Test, and Competitive Assays and Test. </p><p>In Sandwich Assays and Test, the sample flows along the strip, and if the target analyte is present, it binds to both the capture and detector antibodies, forming a sandwich complex. The result is a visible line indicating a positive result. </p><p>Competitive Assays and Test detect the target analyte by competing with a labeled antigen for binding sites on the capture antibody. A visible line indicates a negative result, as the labeled antigen is captured by the antibody and prevents the appearance of a colored line.</p></p>
