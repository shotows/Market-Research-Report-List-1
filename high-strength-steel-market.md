<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Strength Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional HSS</li><li>AHSS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High strength steel is classified into two main types: Conventional HSS and AHSS. Conventional HSS has relatively high strength compared to traditional steel but is still considered low in terms of strength. On the other hand, Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) offers even greater strength and lighter weight, making it ideal for applications where both strength and weight are important factors. AHSS is further divided into different categories based on their strength levels, such as Dual Phase steel, TRIP steel, and Martensitic steel.</p></p>
