<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Aluminate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-melting</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium aluminate is produced in two main types: Pre-melting and Sintered. Pre-melting calcium aluminate is created by melting raw materials in a high-temperature furnace and then cooling and grinding the resulting material. This type is commonly used in the production of refractory materials. Sintered calcium aluminate, on the other hand, is formed by compacting and heating raw materials at lower temperatures, resulting in a denser and more uniform product. Sintered calcium aluminate is often used in construction materials such as cements and mortars.</p></p>
