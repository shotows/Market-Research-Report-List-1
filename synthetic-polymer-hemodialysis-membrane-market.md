<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Polymer Hemodialysis Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The synthetic polymer hemodialysis membrane market consists of two types: low flux membrane and high flux membrane. Low flux membranes have a smaller pore size, restricting the movement of large molecules and increasing the selectivity of small molecule removal during hemodialysis. High flux membranes, on the other hand, have a larger pore size, allowing for the effective removal of both small and larger molecules during hemodialysis. These different types of membranes cater to different patient needs and provide more options for tailored hemodialysis treatments.</p></p>
