<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural tractor tires can be classified into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial tires have a more flexible sidewall and provide better traction and fuel efficiency, making them suitable for heavy-duty farming applications. Bias tires, on the other hand, have a stiffer sidewall and are more durable, making them ideal for rough terrains and heavy loads. Both types of tires have their own strengths and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the farming operation.</p></p>
