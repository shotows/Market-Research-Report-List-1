<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Targeted Drugs for Multiple Myeloma Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immunomodulator</li><li>Proteasome Inhibitors</li><li>Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACI)</li><li>Monoclonal Antibody</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Targeted drugs for multiple myeloma can be classified into several market types. Immunomodulators stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Proteasome inhibitors block the action of enzymes responsible for degrading proteins in cancer cells, leading to their accumulation and death. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) regulate gene expression by modifying the proteins that package DNA, potentially suppressing tumor growth. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced proteins that specifically target cancer cells, helping the immune system to destroy them. Other market types may include drugs targeting specific molecular pathways involved in multiple myeloma's growth and survival.</p></p>
