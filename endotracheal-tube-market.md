<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed</li><li>Uncuffeds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endotracheal tubes are divided into two main types: cuffed and uncuffed. Cuffed tubes have an inflatable cuff that creates a seal in the trachea, preventing air leakage and aspiration of secretions. They are commonly used in patients who require mechanical ventilation or have a high risk of aspiration. Uncuffed tubes do not have a cuff and are mainly used in patients with normal airway anatomy or during short-term procedures. The choice between cuffed and uncuffed tubes depends on the patient's specific needs and condition.</p></p>
