<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silica Board Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterproof</li><li>Not Waterproof</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silica board exists in two main market types: waterproof and not waterproof. Waterproof silica board is designed to repel moisture and resist water damage, making it ideal for use in damp environments such as bathrooms or kitchens. On the other hand, not waterproof silica board does not have water-resistant properties and is better suited for dry areas where water exposure is minimal. Both types of silica board offer different advantages depending on the specific needs of the project or application.</p></p>
