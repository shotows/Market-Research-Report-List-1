<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Personalized Vaccine</li><li>Off-the-shelf Neovaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neoantigen cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to specifically target and attack cancer cells based on their unique neoantigens. Personalized vaccines are tailored to each individual patient, utilizing their own neoantigens. These vaccines are created by sequencing the patient's tumor DNA and developing a personalized vaccine to stimulate an immune response against their specific cancer. Off-the-shelf neovaccines, on the other hand, are not personalized and are designed to target common neoantigens found in multiple patients' tumors, making them more readily available for administration to a broader population.</p></p>
