<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Embedding Stimulator</li><li>Semi-embedding Stimulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A full embedding spinal stimulator is a device that is completely implanted under the skin, providing continuous pain relief through electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. In contrast, a semi-embedding spinal stimulator is partially implanted with a portion of the device remaining external to the skin. Both types of stimulators are used in the treatment of chronic pain conditions and offer patients a non-pharmacological alternative for managing their symptoms. The market for these devices continues to expand as more individuals seek non-invasive pain relief solutions.</p></p>
