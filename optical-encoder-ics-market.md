<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Encoder Ics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmissive Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical encoder ICs are classified into two main types: transmissive and reflective. Transmissive type encoders consist of a light source and a photodetector placed on opposite sides of a rotating disc. As the disc turns, the light is interrupted by slits on the disc, and the changes in light intensity are used to determine position. Reflective type encoder, on the other hand, reflects light off the rotating disc to a photodetector, which detects the changes in light intensity to calculate position.</p></p>
