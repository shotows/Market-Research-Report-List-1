<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle brake calipers come in two main types: single piston calipers and multi-piston calipers. Single piston calipers have one piston on each side of the brake rotor, providing even pressure distribution on both sides. On the other hand, multi-piston calipers have multiple pistons on each side of the rotor, offering more precise and powerful braking performance. Single piston calipers are commonly found in smaller vehicles, while multi-piston calipers are often used in high-performance vehicles that require enhanced braking capabilities.</p></p>
