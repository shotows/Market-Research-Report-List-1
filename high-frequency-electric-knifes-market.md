<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electric Knifes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High frequency electric knives are available in two main market types: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. Monopolar Circuit knives use a single electrode for cutting, while the electrical current flows through the patient's body to a grounding pad. This type is commonly used for general surgery. On the other hand, Bipolar Circuit knives have two electrodes located on the tips of the instrument, which allows for precise cutting without the current passing through the patient's body. This type is commonly used for delicate procedures such as neurosurgery.</p></p>
