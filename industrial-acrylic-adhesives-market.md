<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Acrylic Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial acrylic adhesives are commonly categorized into two main types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based acrylic adhesives are environmentally friendly, non-toxic, and easily cleaned up with water. They are suitable for bonding porous materials and have a longer shelf life. On the other hand, solvent-based acrylic adhesives are known for their fast drying times and strong initial bond strength. They are ideal for bonding non-porous materials and are more resistant to temperature fluctuations. Both types of adhesives have their own set of advantages and are used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
