<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membranes for Guided Tissue and Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membranes for guided tissue and bone regeneration are used in dental and orthopedic surgeries to facilitate the healing process and promote tissue growth. The absorbable membrane, as the name implies, gradually breaks down and is absorbed by the body over time. This eliminates the need for a second surgery to remove the membrane. On the other hand, non-resorbable membranes remain in the body indefinitely and require a separate surgical procedure for removal. Both types of membranes provide support and protection to enhance tissue and bone regeneration.</p></p>
