<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Vascular Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Coronary VCDs</li><li>Non-Invasive Coronary VCDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coronary Vascular Closure Devices (VCDs) are used to seal the puncture created during catheterization procedures in the heart. There are two main types of Coronary VCDs - Invasive and Non-Invasive. Invasive Coronary VCDs require the use of a catheter for insertion, while Non-Invasive Coronary VCDs do not require a catheter and use external pressure to achieve hemostasis. Both types of devices are important in reducing bleeding complications and improving patient outcomes following cardiac procedures.</p></p>
