<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rigid PU Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-reactive Amine Catalysts</li><li>Reactive Amine Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rigid PU Catalyst Market Types can be classified into two categories: non-reactive amine catalysts and reactive amine catalysts. Non-reactive amine catalysts are used to accelerate the reaction rate of polyurethane (PU) systems without participating in the chemical reaction itself. On the other hand, reactive amine catalysts not only speed up the reaction but also become a part of the final PU structure. Both types play a crucial role in controlling the curing process and properties of rigid PU foams.</p></p>
