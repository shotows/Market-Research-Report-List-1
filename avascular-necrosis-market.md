<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Avascular Necrosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li><li>Non-Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a condition where the bone tissue dies due to inadequate blood supply. There are two main types of AVN: trauma-related and non-trauma related. Trauma-related AVN occurs due to injury or trauma to the bone, such as fractures or dislocations, which disrupts the blood flow. On the other hand, non-trauma related AVN is caused by factors like excessive alcohol consumption, long-term use of corticosteroids, or medical conditions like sickle cell disease. Both types of AVN result in bone tissue death, leading to pain, limited joint movement, and potential joint collapse.</p></p>
